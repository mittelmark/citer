Tcl package to create bibliographies using Bibtex files

This is a Tcl package and a simpel standalone application to work with Bibtex
files. 

The documentation of the package and the application can be seen here:
[citer/citer.html]([citer](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mittelmark/citer/blob/master/citer/citer.html).

The package was mainly developed to be embedded within the Pantcl document
processor to allow reporting writing as well with references. An example can
be seen here for the Pipe filter which utilizes R for statistics and plots. Here the [filter-pipe documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mittelmark/pantcl/master/lib/tclfilters/filter-pipe.html).
